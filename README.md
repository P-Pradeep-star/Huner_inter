How It Works 🛠️

1. The program randomly selects a number within a specified range (default: 1–100).


2. The player is prompted to guess the number.


3. Feedback is provided after each guess:

"Too High!" if the guess is higher than the target.

"Too Low!" if the guess is lower than the target.

"Correct!" if the guess matches the target.



4. The total number of attempts is displayed after a successful guess.


5. The player can choose to play another round or exit the game.
